  <h3>For times where you are either lazy to write media queries or you don't have need for a mobile adaptive website</h3> 
  <br>
  
   nullResponsive is a customizable splash screen that replaces your sites view when breakpoints (mobile | desktop) are reached, essentially covering the mess your site is without media queries

    breakpoint: 1000,
    imgPath: "img.jpeg",
    bg_color: "#e6e6fb",
    text_color: "#858586",
};
   Vue.use(nullResponsive, nullConfig)
```
<br>
